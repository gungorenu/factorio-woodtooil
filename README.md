# factorio-woodtooil
a mod for factorio - wood to oil



yet another "wood to oil" mod. introduces Hydrothermal Liquefaction process. requires wood, light oil and water in oil refinery and produces crude oil.
also includes a way of producing wood but it is slow for balance perspective.

includes one more new item: Fertilizer, required for wood production (sulfur and stone)

includes one more new building: Arborium, produces wood (water, landfill and fertilizer). no module accepted in this building.

it is not meant to be for end game level. but for getting rid of wood or moving to another path compared to cracking. also a way of making stone useful.
